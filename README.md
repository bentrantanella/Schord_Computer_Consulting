# Schord_Computer_Consulting

Launched a computer consulting company focused on web design, web application development, general coding (primarily Python and Java), 
graphic design with an emphasis on social media, and tutoring for high school students in AP Computer Science. Deployed schordcomputerconsulting.com, 
which contains a number of free web-based calculators for runners, including one to calculate their desired pace per lap on any size track, 
since indoor tracks often have non-standard lengths. Developed a series of graphical templates for the Union College cross country and track & field teams 
to post information on Instagram that highlights recent performances and upcoming events.
